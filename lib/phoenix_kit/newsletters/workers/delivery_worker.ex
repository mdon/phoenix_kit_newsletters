defmodule PhoenixKit.Newsletters.Workers.DeliveryWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Oban worker for sending a single broadcast email to one recipient.

  ## Job Arguments

  - `delivery_uuid` - UUID of the Delivery record
  - `broadcast_uuid` - UUID of the Broadcast record

  ## Queue Configuration

  Add to your Oban config (core's installer does this for you):

      config :my_app, Oban,
        queues: [newsletters_delivery: 10]

  The queue name is fixed by this worker — a host that configures a queue
  under any other name runs no delivery jobs at all.

  Queue concurrency is the only ceiling this module leans on. Per-broadcast
  pacing is separate and lives in `PhoenixKit.Newsletters.Broadcaster`:
  `send_interval_seconds/1` derives an interval from the send profile's
  `rate_per_hour` / `rate_per_day` / `pause_seconds` and schedules job N that
  far out. There is no module-level rate-limit setting.

  #     non-terminal delivery — the exact condition maybe_finalize_broadcast/1
  #     watches for. A broadcast could then finalize to "sent" while its
  #     queue is still draining.
  #   * A cancelled broadcast is not swept: maybe_finalize_broadcast/1 and

  #     only, so deliveries left "pending" under it sit inert rather than
  #     dragging it anywhere.
